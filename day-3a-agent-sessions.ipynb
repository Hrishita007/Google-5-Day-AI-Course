Companies are reporting the discovery of novel drug candidates in months, not years.\n*   **Virtual Screening at Scale:** AI allows for the rapid virtual screening of millions or even billions of potential drug compounds against a target, identifying promising candidates much faster and more cost-effectively than traditional high-throughput screening.\n\n**2. Protein Folding and Structure Prediction:**\n\n*   **AlphaFold's Impact:** DeepMind's AlphaFold has been a game-changer in predicting the 3D structure of proteins from their amino acid sequence. Knowing a protein's structure is crucial for understanding its function and designing drugs that can bind to it. This has opened up possibilities for targeting proteins that were previously considered \"undruggable.\"\n*   **New Tools and Algorithms:** Building on AlphaFold's success, new algorithms and tools are emerging to further refine protein structure prediction and explore protein dynamics.\n\n**3. Advancements in \"Undruggable\" Targets:**\n\n*   **Targeting Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs):** Many diseases are driven by disruptions in how proteins interact. Developing drugs that modulate these interactions has been notoriously difficult. New chemical modalities and AI-driven approaches are showing promise in this area.\n*   **Epigenetic Modifiers:** AI is helping to identify and develop drugs that target epigenetic mechanisms (changes in gene expression that don't involve alterations to the DNA sequence), offering new avenues for treating diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.\n\n**4. Novel Modalities Beyond Small Molecules and Antibodies:**\n\n*   **Oligonucleotide Therapeutics:** This class of drugs, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), targets RNA to regulate gene expression. AI is helping to design more effective and targeted oligonucleotides.\n*   **Peptide Therapeutics:** Peptides offer unique therapeutic properties, and AI is aiding in the design and optimization of peptide-based drugs.\n*   **Cell and Gene Therapies:** While not strictly \"drug\" discovery in the traditional sense, AI is also playing a role in optimizing the design and delivery of these complex therapies.\n\n**5.

This is a truly groundbreaking area in drug discovery. Let me elaborate:\n\n**The Challenge of Protein Structure:**\n\nProteins are the workhorses of our cells. They perform an incredible variety of functions, from catalyzing biochemical reactions to transporting molecules and providing structural support. The shape, or **3D structure**, of a protein is absolutely critical to its function. A protein's shape dictates:\n\n*   **Where it binds to other molecules:** This includes other proteins, DNA, RNA, and importantly, potential drug molecules.\n*   **How it interacts with its environment:** This can influence its stability and activity.\n*   **Its biological role:** A misfolded protein can lead to disease.\n\nFor decades, determining the precise 3D structure of a protein was a painstakingly slow and expensive process, often involving experimental techniques like X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy. This meant that the structures of only a fraction of the proteins in the human body were known.\n\n**The Breakthrough: AI-Powered Structure Prediction (e.g., AlphaFold)**\n\nThis is where AI, specifically deep learning, has made a revolutionary leap.\n\n*   **What is AlphaFold?** Developed by Google DeepMind, AlphaFold is an AI system that can predict the 3D structure of a protein with remarkable accuracy, solely from its amino acid sequence. Think of it like having a highly sophisticated predictor that can \"guess\" the final folded shape of a protein based on the linear chain of its building blocks.\n*   **How does it work (in simplified terms)?** AlphaFold uses a deep neural network that learns patterns from known protein structures and sequences. It analyzes the amino acid sequence and uses evolutionary information (conserved amino acids in related proteins across species) to infer how the sequence will fold into its functional 3D shape.\n*   **The Impact:**\n    *   **Massive Public Databases:** DeepMind made the predicted structures of over 200 million proteins available in a publicly accessible database. This is an unprecedented resource for researchers worldwide.\n    *   **Unlocking \"Undruggable\" Targets:** Many disease-causing proteins have structures that are difficult to determine experimentally, or they are notoriously hard to design drugs for. Knowing their predicted structures opens up new possibilities for designing drugs that can bind to them and modulate their activity. For example, researchers can now explore how to inhibit proteins involved in cancer or neurodegenerative diseases that were previously out of reach.\n    *   **Accelerating Drug Design:** Instead of spending months or years determining a protein's structure, researchers can now obtain a highly accurate prediction in minutes or hours. This significantly speeds up the initial stages of drug discovery.\n    *   **Understanding Disease Mechanisms:** By seeing the structures of mutated or altered proteins, scientists can gain deeper insights into how diseases develop and progress at a molecular level.\n    *   **Designing New Proteins:** Beyond predicting existing structures, AI tools are also being developed to design entirely novel proteins with specific functions.\n\n**Beyond AlphaFold:**\n\nWhile AlphaFold is the most prominent example, it has spurred significant innovation in the field. Other AI models and tools are being developed to:\n\n*   **Predict protein-protein interactions:** How different proteins bind to each other.\n*   **Understand protein dynamics:** How proteins move and change shape over time, which is crucial for their function.\n*   **Predict the effects of mutations:** How changes in a protein's sequence can alter its structure and function, leading to disease.\n\n**In summary, AI-powered protein structure prediction, exemplified by AlphaFold, has fundamentally changed the landscape of biological research and drug discovery. It provides an accessible and powerful tool for understanding the building blocks of life and for identifying new ways to intervene in disease processes by designing targeted therapies.**\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the companies and organizations at the forefront of **AI-driven protein structure prediction and its application in drug discovery**.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
